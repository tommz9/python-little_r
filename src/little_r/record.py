c     ... this is a little testing routine that is supposed to generate a 
c         single sounding that the objective analysis program will ingest

c     ... pressure is in Pa, height in m, temperature and dew point are in
c         K, speed is in m/s, and direction is in degrees

c     ... sea level pressure is in Pa, terrain elevation is in m, latitude
c         is in degrees N, longitude is in degrees E

c     ... to put in a surface observation, make only a single level "sounding"
c         and make the value of the height equal the terrain elevation -- PRESTO!

c     ... the first 40 character string may be used for the description of
c         the station (i.e. name city country, etc)

c     ... the second character string we use for our source

c     ... the third string should be left alone, it uses the phrase "FM-35 TEMP"
c         for an upper air station, and should use "FM-12 SYNOP" for surface data

c     ... the fourth string is unused, feel free to experiment with labels!

c     ... bogus data are not subject to quality control

c     ... There are 3 records for each observation site:
c     1. a header that contains information about station identifier, 
c        station location, data information, station elevation
c        and whether the report is a bogus or not, etc;
c     2. a report (whether it is a sounding containing many levels, or only a surface report)
c     3. an end-of-message line.

c     ... For a surface observation, the geopotential height (z(k)) 
c         must be set equal to the terrain elevation (ter) field.
c         This is the definition of a surface observation.
